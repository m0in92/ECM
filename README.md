### Copywrite©️ 2023 by Moin Ahmed. All Rights Reserved.

<p>
This repository contains the code for simulating the terminal voltage of the lithium-ion battery (LIB) using 
Thevenin equivalent-circuit model (ECM).
</p>

### Features:
- Thevenin ECM model
- Sigma-Point Kalman Filter (SPKF) for ECM model to account for process and sensor noise.
